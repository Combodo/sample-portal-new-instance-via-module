Sample [iTop](https://github.com/Combodo/iTop) module to show how to add a new user portal instance.

**Warning** : this is not yet compatible with iTop >= 2.7.0, as [user portal was migrated from Silex to Symfony](https://www.itophub.io/wiki/page?id=2_7_0%3Ainstall%3A260_to_270_migration_notes#incompatible_extensions).
